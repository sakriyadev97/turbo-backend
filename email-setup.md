# Email Setup Guide for Turbo Backend

## Issue Fixed
The PDF was not being attached to emails because the email credentials were not configured.

## Required Environment Variables

You need to create a `.env` file in the `turbo_backend` directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Email Configuration for Gmail SMTP
EMAIL_USER=turboprecision2@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password_here

# Database Configuration (if needed)
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here

# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
HOST=localhost
```

## Gmail App Password Setup

Since you're using Gmail, you need to create an "App Password" instead of your regular password:

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Select "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)"
   - Name it "Turbo Backend"
   - Copy the generated 16-character password
3. **Use the App Password** in your `.env` file

## Testing the Fix

After setting up the environment variables:

1. **Restart your backend server**
2. **Test the email endpoint**:
   ```bash
   POST /api/email/send-bulk-order-email
   ```
3. **Check the console logs** for PDF generation status
4. **Verify the email** contains the PDF attachment

## What Was Fixed

1. **Environment Variable Validation**: Added checks for missing email credentials
2. **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages when email is not configured
3. **PDF Attachment Logic**: Improved the logic for adding PDF attachments to emails
4. **Logging**: Added console logs to track PDF generation and attachment status

## Troubleshooting

If you still don't see PDFs:

1. **Check console logs** for PDF generation errors
2. **Verify environment variables** are loaded correctly
3. **Test PDF generation** separately using the test-pdf.js file
4. **Check Gmail settings** - PDFs might be in spam or blocked

## Security Note

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Use App Passwords instead of regular passwords
- Consider using environment-specific configuration files
